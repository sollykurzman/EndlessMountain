This game is called Endless Mountain, you are a skier, and you must use the left and right keys to dodge the trees.

The turn aspect of the game is implemented with each frame refresh/repaint of the HTML Canvas; in each turn, the player can play left, right or nothing.

Board-based is achieved through a coordinates system of player and obstacle positions as an x y position, and collisions are calculated using this and the player and obstacle widths.

The API documentation can be found by clicking on API Docs under the title of the game.
